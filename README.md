##HTTP Server with Cows

###Learn what cows have to say!

The initial page will be a form asking you to select a cow breed. Choose one,
you will then see what that cow has to say.

But don't try to manually enter the "/form" path or you will get a cow giving you an
error message.

Enter one of the cow breeds manually into the url path as another valid way to choose
a cow breed:

... such as "/holstein"

Or make the cow say whatever you want by adding a query string with the key word "talk" after the cow breed:

... such as "/jersey?talk=mississippi"
